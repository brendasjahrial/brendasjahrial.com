Anti-immigration sentiment was on the rise and a human rights issue is becoming increasingly politicised.

**How do we cut through the noise and get people to stand up for the rights of refugees and people seeking asylum?**

#### The insight 

The UK asylum system is objectively designed for people to fail. The odds are stacked against asylum seekers at every point. But after spending days shadowing resettled refugees and caseworkers from Refugee Action, what struck us most was the fierce drive and resilience they carried with them.

#### The strategy 

Refugee Action has been fighting injustices for years but their brand was passive and outdated. We put this unrelenting spirit at the heart of their new brand, showcasing the energy and commitment from both the charity and the people they work with.

From this, we created a bold, confident logo, along with a dramatic colour palette and a repetitive type treatment to symbolise the ongoing fight.
