      <p>I grew up in Jakarta and Singapore, before coming to London to study advertising at UAL. Since my degree, I’ve worked on campaigns and brand strategies for innocent, Nando’s, Macmillan and WWF.</p>
      <p>I love researching and getting immersed in different worlds, finding new ways of looking at things and turning them into compelling stories.</p>
